            <h3>about</h3>
            <p>
                I am a software developer interested in solving problems in natural language and artificial intelligence, both academic and practical. I like thinking about abstractions and their role in understanding. I want to contribute to bridging the communication gap that exists between the field of A.I. and its popular understanding.
            </p>
            <h3>current</h3>
            <p>
                I am currently employed as a software developer at <a href="http://www.ibm.com/watson/">IBM Watson</a>.
