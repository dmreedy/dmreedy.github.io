            <h1>about</h1>
            <p>
            I am a software developer interested in solving problems in natural language and artificial intelligence, both academic and practical. I like thinking about abstractions and their role in understanding. I want to contribute to bridging the communication gap that exists between the field of A.I. and its popular understanding.
            </p>
            <h1>current</h1>
            <p>
            I am currently employed at IBM.
